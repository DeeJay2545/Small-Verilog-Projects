# Small Verilog Projects
Collection of Small Verilog Projects

Lab #1 - Basic Verilog counter.

Lab #2 - Counter that activates LEDs. Demonstration --> https://youtu.be/o4ibC-RMd1A

Lab #3 - LED sequence that changes with each button press. Demonstration --> https://youtu.be/KWLWRMqETmI

Lab #4 - Seven-segment display demonstration. Number on the seven-segment display will either increase or decrese depending on the button pressed.

Lab #5 - Verilog state machine. The state is based on the 2-bit input switch. Output is on the seven-segment display. Demonstration --> https://youtu.be/JxweCZ6s_u8

Lab #6 - Reflex timer. An LED will activate on the FPGA and a player has to react as fast as possible. Reaction time is diplayed on the seven-segment display.
